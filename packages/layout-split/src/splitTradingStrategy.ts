 * Split trading layout strategy.

 * entry sub-panels. All state is managed internally by the Renderer.
 *
 * Pass this as `layoutStrategy` to DesktopLayout (via the interceptor in
 * registerLayoutSplitPlugin) so LayoutHost calls SplitTradingLayout as the
 * Renderer with the PanelRegistry built by trading-next.
