# Withdrawal

`@orderly.network/hooks` provides the following hooks to facilitate withdrawals:

- `useWithdraw` - Withdraw

## Terminology

### Max withdrawable amount

`maxAmount` - The maximum balance that can be withdrawn at this moment (without having to settle PnL).


### Available Balance

`availableBalance` - The available balance of the account, which is equal to the amount that can be withdrawn after settling all outstanding unsettled PnL.


### Unsettled PnL

`unsettledPnL` - Amount of PnL that has not been settled into the account balance yet. Balance will be available to withdraw once PnL has been settled (if positive).



All of the above data can be retrieved through `useWithdraw`.

```typescript
const { withdraw, isLoading, maxAmount, availableBalance, unsettledPnL } =
  useWithdraw();
```

## Withdraw

### `useWithdraw()`

```typescript
import { useWithdraw } from "@orderly.network/hooks";

const { withdraw, isLoading } = useWithdraw();

const res = await withdraw();
```

### Withdrawal status

Subscribe to the relevant websocket topic to get updates on the withdrawal status.

```typescript
import { useWS } from "@orderly.network/hooks";

//...

export const Example = () => {
  const ws = useWS();

  useEffect(() => {
    const unsubscribe = ws.subscribe(
      {
        id: "wallet",
        event: "subscribe",
        topic: "wallet",
        ts: Date.now(),
      },
      {
        onMessage: (data: any) => {
          //
        },
      }
    );

    return () => {
      unsubscribe();
    };
  }, [ws]);
};
```
