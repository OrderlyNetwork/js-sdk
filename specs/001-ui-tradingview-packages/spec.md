# Feature Specification: UI TradingView Package Refactoring

**Feature Branch**: `001-ui-tradingview-packages`
**Created**: 2025-10-13
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "计划重构ui-tradingview包，请先分析 packages/ui-tradingview中现在的实现，整合为需要实现的spec。请在现有的spec上更新，需要支持绘制orderLine,positionLine, tpslLine等，参考现有的实现"

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### User Story 1 - Developer Integration (Priority: P1)

As a developer integrating the Orderly SDK, I want to easily use TradingView charts without dealing with complex internal dependencies, so that I can quickly add trading charts to my application.

**Why this priority**: Critical for developer adoption and integration experience - this is the primary user journey for external developers.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by importing the refactored package in a test application and rendering a basic chart with market data.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a developer installs the refactored ui-tradingview package, **When** they import and use the TradingView component, **Then** the chart renders successfully with minimal configuration
2. **Given** a developer wants to customize chart appearance, **When** they apply theme and styling configurations, **Then** the chart updates accordingly without breaking functionality

---

### User Story 2 - Modular Functionality (Priority: P1)

As a developer, I want to use only the specific TradingView features I need (charts, order management, or position display), so that my application bundle size remains optimized.

**Why this priority**: Essential for performance and flexibility - developers shouldn't be forced to bundle unused features.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by creating separate test applications that import only chart functionality, only order management, and only position display features.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a developer only needs chart display, **When** they import the chart module, **Then** the bundle includes only chart-related code without order management features
2. **Given** a developer needs both charts and order management, **When** they import both modules, **Then** both features work together seamlessly
3. **Given** a developer wants to add features incrementally, **When** they import additional modules, **Then** existing functionality remains unaffected

---

### User Story 3 - Dependency Management (Priority: P2)

As a maintainer of the Orderly SDK, I want clear dependency boundaries between TradingView components, so that updates to one component don't break others.

**Why this priority**: Important for long-term maintainability and reducing integration risks when updating individual components.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by updating individual component packages in isolation and verifying that other components continue to function normally.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the chart data provider needs updates, **When** the data provider package is updated, **Then** order management and position display continue to work normally
2. **Given** a new trading feature is added, **When** the feature is implemented as a separate module, **Then** existing modules don't require updates
3. **Given** dependency versions change, **When** packages are updated, **Then** the dependency graph remains acyclic and healthy

---

### User Story 4 - Trading Line Visualization (Priority: P1)

As a trader, I want to see my orders, positions, and stop-loss/take-profit levels directly on the chart, so that I can quickly understand my trading status and make informed decisions.

**Why this priority**: Essential for trading user experience - visual representation of trading elements is critical for traders to monitor their positions and orders effectively.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by creating a test application with simulated trading data and verifying that order lines, position lines, and TPSL lines render correctly on the chart.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a trader has pending orders, **When** the chart loads, **Then** order lines are displayed at the correct price levels with order details
2. **Given** a trader has open positions, **When** the chart displays, **Then** position lines show entry price and current P&L information
3. **Given** a trader has stop-loss or take-profit orders, **When** viewing the chart, **Then** TPSL lines are clearly visible and distinguishable from regular orders
4. **Given** trading data changes, **When** orders are filled or positions are closed, **Then** corresponding lines are removed from the chart immediately

---

### User Story 5 - Interactive Trading Line Management (Priority: P2)

As a trader, I want to interact with trading lines directly on the chart to modify or cancel orders, so that I can quickly adjust my trading strategy without leaving the chart interface.

**Why this priority**: Important for trading efficiency - the ability to manage orders directly from the chart significantly improves trading workflow.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by simulating user interactions with trading lines and verifying that order modifications and cancellations are processed correctly.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an order line is displayed on the chart, **When** a trader drags the line to a new price level, **Then** the order is modified to the new price
2. **Given** a trader wants to cancel an order, **When** they interact with the order line, **Then** a cancellation option is available and the order is removed when confirmed
3. **Given** a position line is displayed, **When** a trader interacts with it, **Then** position details and closing options are presented
4. **Given** TPSL lines are displayed, **When** a trader modifies them, **Then** the associated stop-loss or take-profit orders are updated accordingly

---

### User Story 6 - Responsive Design (Priority: P2)

As a developer using the TradingView SDK on different devices, I want the chart to automatically adapt to desktop and mobile layouts, so that my application provides optimal user experience across all screen sizes.

**Why this priority**: Essential for modern web applications - mobile and desktop users have different interaction patterns and space constraints.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by rendering the chart on different screen sizes and verifying layout adaptation occurs at the correct breakpoints.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user views the chart on a mobile device (< 768px width), **When** the page loads, **Then** UI components use mobile-optimized layouts with touch-friendly controls
2. **Given** a user views the chart on a desktop device (≥ 768px width), **When** the page loads, **Then** UI components use full desktop layouts with mouse-optimized controls
3. **Given** a user resizes the browser window across the breakpoint, **When** the screen size changes, **Then** the layout adapts within 100ms without losing chart state
4. **Given** a user is on mobile, **When** they interact with time interval selector, **Then** a mobile-optimized dropdown appears with simplified options
