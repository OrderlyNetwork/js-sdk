**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/, quickstart.md

**Tests**: Optional - Only include tests if explicitly requested in feature specification

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3, US4, US5)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

- **Core package**: `packages/ui-tradingview/src/`
- **Plugins**: `packages/ui-tradingview/src/plugins/{name}/`
- **Types**: `packages/ui-tradingview/src/types/`
- **Tests**: `packages/ui-tradingview/tests/` or respective plugin tests

<!--

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3-7)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories can then proceed in parallel (if staffed)
  - Or sequentially in priority order (US1 ‚Üí US2 ‚Üí US4 ‚Üí US3 ‚Üí US5)
- **Polish (Phase 8)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - May integrate with US1 but should be independently testable
- **User Story 4 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Depends on core chart functionality from US1/US2
- **User Story 3 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Applies to all other stories
- **User Story 5 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Depends on US4 for trading line visualization

### Within Each User Story

- Core plugin infrastructure before specific plugin implementations
- Plugin packages can be created in parallel [P]
- Plugin core logic and adapters can be developed in parallel [P]
- Integration happens after individual plugin completion

### Parallel Opportunities

- All Setup tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- All Foundational tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (within Phase 2)
- Once Foundational phase completes, US1, US2, and US4 can start in parallel (if team capacity allows)
- All plugin packages can be created in parallel
- Plugin core implementations can be developed in parallel

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 4 (Trading Line Visualization)

```bash
# Launch all plugin directory creation tasks together:
Task: "Create order line plugin directory structure in packages/ui-tradingview/src/plugins/order-line/"
Task: "Create position line plugin directory structure in packages/ui-tradingview/src/plugins/position-line/"
Task: "Create TPSL plugin directory structure in packages/ui-tradingview/src/plugins/tpsl/"

# Launch all plugin core implementations together:
Task: "Implement order line plugin core in packages/ui-tradingview/src/plugins/order-line/OrderLinePlugin.ts"
Task: "Implement position line plugin core in packages/ui-tradingview/src/plugins/position-line/PositionLinePlugin.ts"
Task: "Implement TPSL plugin core in packages/ui-tradingview/src/plugins/tpsl/TPSLPlugin.ts"
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Stories 1 + 2 + 4 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 - Basic chart integration
4. Complete Phase 4: User Story 2 - Modular functionality
5. Complete Phase 5: User Story 4 - Trading line visualization
6. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test core functionality (chart + basic trading lines)
7. Deploy/demo if ready

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational ‚Üí Foundation ready
2. Add User Story 1 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (Basic chart)
3. Add User Story 2 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (Modular chart)
4. Add User Story 4 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (Chart with trading lines)
5. Add User Story 3 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (With dependency management)
6. Add User Story 5 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (Full interactive trading)
7. Each story adds value without breaking previous stories

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - Developer A: User Story 1 (Chart integration)
   - Developer B: User Story 2 (Modular functionality)
   - Developer C: User Story 4 (Trading line plugins)
3. Stories complete and integrate independently
4. Developer D: User Story 3 (Dependency management)
5. Developer E: User Story 5 (Interactive features)

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Tasks T007-T014 (Foundational) are critical - no user story work can begin until complete
- User Stories 1, 2, and 4 are P1 priority and should be completed first
- Plugin directories (T029-T032) enable independent development and testing within the same package
- Bundle size optimization is a cross-cutting concern addressed in multiple phases
- Performance targets (<100ms plugin registration, <200ms line rendering) should be validated after each user story completion
